# Project 5:
**Title:** Workplace Safety - Data Manipulation Interrogation

**SQL Code:** [Workplace SQL](https://github.com/AbisolaTracy/AbisolaTracy.github.io/blob/main/Workplace%20SQL)

![Workplace](Workplace.png)

**Project Description:** 

This project analyzes a dataset of workplace safety incidents recorded across multiple plants, departments, shifts, and employee demographics. Using SQL, I created insightful queries and reports that highlight key safety trends, cost impacts, and workforce risk factors. The main goal of this project is to demonstrate how SQL can be used for workplace safety analytics, helping organizations answer questions like:

* Which departments or plants have the highest number of incidents?
* What are the most costly or severe incident types?
* How are incidents distributed across shifts, age groups, and gender?
* Which areas of the workplace need the most attention to improve safety?

This analysis mimics real-world occupational health & safety reporting, where businesses rely on data to reduce workplace risks and improve safety culture.

**SQL Skills Used:** 
* Data Retrieval: The use of SELECT clause to query and extract specific information.
* Data Source Specification (FROM ): Specified the tables used as data sources for retrieval
* Aggregation & Grouping: Sum, Count of incidents per plant and department, days lost and average costs grouped by incident type.
* Filtering & Conditions: WHERE clause for conditions such as 'Lost Time', 'Near Miss', 'Falling Object', and the use of BETWEEN, IN, to filter specific results.
* Sorting & Ranking: ORDER BY to rank incident types, departments, and **TOP 1** to extract the most critical insights (e.g., highest incident cost, department with most crush & pinch injuries).
* Window Functions: Using OVER (PARTITION BY ...) to calculate max/min costs per incident type or department.
* Pattern Matching (Wildcards): LIKE, %, and _ operators to search for patterns in plant or department names.
* HAVING vs WHERE: Difference between filtering grouped data (HAVING) and filtering raw data (WHERE).

**Technology Used:** Microsoft SQL Server


# Project 6:
**Title:** Salesman SQL Project - Data Manipulation Interrogation

**SQL Code:** [Salesman SQL Codes](https://github.com/AbisolaTracy/AbisolaTracy.github.io/blob/main/Salesman%20SQL%20Codes)

**SQL Skills Used:** 

The project showcases a wide range of SQL skills such as:
* Basic SELECT queries: Retrieving columns with aliases and conditions.
* Filtering with WHERE: Using operators, ranges (BETWEEN), and comparisons.
* JOIN operations: Combining data across multiple tables (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN).
* ORDER BY Clause: Sorting results on numeric and string fields.
* Aggregation logic: Handling grouped conditions such as commission percentages.
* Cartesian Products: CROSS JOIN to create all possible combinations of salespeople and customers.
* NULL handling: Identifying customers or salesmen without relationships.
* Relational reporting: Combining customer, order, and salesman info into professional reports.

**Project Description:** 

This project is a collection of 20 SQL queries designed to practice and demonstrate core database skills using a simple Sales Management System.
The system consists of three relational tables: 
* Salesman: Contains details of salespeople, their working city, and commission rates.
* Customer: Stores information about customers, their assigned salesman, and grade level.
* Orders: Records orders placed by customers, including order date, purchase amount, and the salesperson involved.

The queries answer real-world business questions such as:
* Matching customers with their sales representatives.
* Filtering orders based on conditions (order amount, date, customer grade).
* Generating reports that combine customer, order, and salesman data.
* Creating Cartesian products to simulate potential sales assignments.
* Finding mismatches (e.g., salespeople and customers in different cities).
  
This project simulates the kind of SQL problem-solving needed in business intelligence, reporting, and database-driven application development.

**Technology Used:** 
* Database: Microsoft SQL Server
* Language: SQL (Structured Query Language)
* Schema: Sales Management Schema with 3 main tables: salesman, customer, and orders


# Project 7:

# Project 8:

**Title:** HR Insight

**Tools & Technology Used:** 
* Power BI: For building interactive, dynamic visualizations.
* DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): To create custom KPIs and dynamic measures
* Microsoft Excel: Data extraction, data cleaning and preprocessing
* Power Query: Data cleaning

**Project Description:** 

The HR Dashboard is a comprehensive data visualization solution built to monitor and evaluate the overall human resource landscape of a company. It provides key HR metrics including workforce composition, promotion eligibility, service tenure, and geographical proximity of employees to their workplace.

The goal of this project is to enable HR leaders and decision-makers to proactively manage the workforce, support data-driven strategies for retention, promotion, and retrenchment, and enhance employee satisfaction through evidence-based policy improvements.

**Key Findings:** 

* Employee Growth Visibility: Only 4.90% of employees are due for promotion, indicating a stable workforce but also highlighting the need to review career progression pathways to avoid future stagnation.
* Service Tenure Insights: A large portion of employees have 10+ years of service, which signals organizational loyalty, but may also call for succession planning and potential upskilling programs to ensure ongoing performance and innovation.
* Retrenchment Watchlist: 8% of employees are marked for next retrenchment, offering HR teams a window to review performance, redeployment, or upskilling options to reduce attrition costs and maintain morale.
* Proximity Analysis: A significant number of employees (63.95%) live very close to the office, which can boost productivity, reduce absenteeism, and improve work-life balance. The organization could further explore remote or hybrid options for those living far away to enhance retention.
* Gender Diversity: With a 60/40 male-to-female split, the company maintains moderate gender diversity. This metric can be tracked over time to support diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives.
* Workforce Activity Levels: 92% of employees are currently active, showcasing a high engagement rate. However, tracking this metric over time can help spot early signs of disengagement.
* Job Level Distribution: The majority of employees are clustered in Levels 1 and 2, suggesting a large operational or junior workforce. This insight supports decisions related to training, leadership development, and succession planning.
  
**Dashboard Overview:** 
* Top-Level Metrics:
* Total Employees, Gender Distribution, Promotion Eligibility, Active Workers, and Retrenchment Risk.
* Tenure Analysis: Horizontal bar chart showing employee distribution by years of service.
* Job Levels Breakdown: Bar chart that visualizes the hierarchy across job levels (Level 1 to Level 5).
